\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background and Motivation}
Problem definition

\begin{itemize}
    \item definition of NFC
    \item Quickness vs accuracy
    \item Depletion calculations for LWRs
    \item current practice for depletion calculations [citations]
    \item pros and cons of those practices [citations]
    \item Does it even matter? Fuel cycle simulation is a system-level analysis. How much does it matter? [citations]
\end{itemize}


\gls{NFC} simulations are system-level analyses that track
material flow in a \gls{NFC}. 

Since \gls{NFC} simulations
involve many facilities, the fidelity and detail of modeling each
facility are sacrificed for quickness. 

One of the most crucial functionalities in a \gls{NFC}
simulation is the transmutation of nuclear fuel in a reactor,
which is directly related to the \gls{UNF} composition
and waste / material profile.

Depletion calculations for fuel cycle simulations in current
\gls{NFC} simulators are either
recipe based (no calculation performed), 
library based, [so on and so forth, with citation].



1.The model approach predicts \gls{UNF} inventory far better than
the recipe approach, and takes into account the varying burnup and
enrichment.
2. The model approach can predict the composition of future
\gls{UNF} with higher burnup and enrichment [andrei]

\subsection{Solution}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What can be done - what I've done
    \item What did I do - learning models for each isotope to predict UNF composition given bu and enrichment
    \item Burnup and enrichment -> isotopic composition of UNF
    \item Since all isotopes have different relation to burnup and enrichment
            - example: burnup indicators, not-so-much indicators
    \item Fit models among different choices of algorithms using sklearn
\end{itemize}

A trained depletion model can provide a rapid depletion calculation, while
maintaining accuracy.



\subsubsection{Machine learning prediction algorithms}

\begin{itemize}
    \item plug about machine learning
    \item how easy it is keras, hyperparameter search and stuff
    \item easier to predict
\end{itemize}
