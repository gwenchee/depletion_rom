\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
Problem definition
\begin{itemize}
    \item definition of NFC
    \item Quickness vs accuracy
    \item Depletion calculations for LWRs
    \item current practice for depletion calculations
    \item pros and cons of those practices
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Solution}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What can be done - what I've done
    \item What did I do - learning models for each isotope to predict UNF composition given bu and enrichment
    \item Burnup and enrichment -> isotopic composition of UNF
    \item Since all isotopes have different relation to burnup and enrichment
            - example: burnup indicators, not-so-much indicators
    \item Fit models among different choices of algorithms using sklearn
\end{itemize}
