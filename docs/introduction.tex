\section{Introduction}
[definition of NFC]
[Quickness vs accuracy]
[Depletion calculations for LWRs]
[current practice for depletion calculations]
[pros and cons of those practices]

[What did I do - learning models for each isotope]
[using UNF-STANDARDS database for PWR depletion calculations]
[note the criticality exaggeration stuff]
[Burnup and enrichment -> isotopic composition of UNF]
[Since all isotopes have different relation to burnup and enrichment
    - example: burnup indicators, not-so-much indicators]
[Fit models among different choices of algorithms using sklearn]

[The trained models are pickled for validation / testing]
[compared with two things]
    [UNF standards database UNF inventory comparison]
    [SERPENT depletion calculation prediction for `futuristic' LWR fuels]
