\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
Problem definition
\begin{itemize}
    \item definition of NFC
    \item Quickness vs accuracy
    \item Depletion calculations for LWRs
    \item current practice for depletion calculations
    \item pros and cons of those practices
    \item Does it even matter? Fuel cycle simulation is a system-level analysis
\end{itemize}

\gls{NFC} simulations are system-level analyses that track
material flow in a \gls{NFC}. A large system-level analysis
involves a multitude of nuclear facilities. Having a high-fidelity
modeling tool for each facility is too computationally burdensome.



\subsection{Solution}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What can be done - what I've done
    \item What did I do - learning models for each isotope to predict UNF composition given bu and enrichment
    \item Burnup and enrichment -> isotopic composition of UNF
    \item Since all isotopes have different relation to burnup and enrichment
            - example: burnup indicators, not-so-much indicators
    \item Fit models among different choices of algorithms using sklearn
\end{itemize}

A trained depletion model can provide a rapid depletion calculation, while
maintaining accuracy.
