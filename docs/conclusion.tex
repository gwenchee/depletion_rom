\section{Conclusion}

[plug about how it's `validated' against the trained dataset]
We cannot avoid the criticism that the model is validated
against the dataset used to train the model. However, the purpose
of this work is to create a model that can quickly reproduce the
database without having to distribute the database, which is proprietary
and large in size. For the purpose of having an accessible
depletion model, this method holds promise.


eh, it's not the best, and it takes a really long time to get them going,
but it's good enough, isn't it?

future work:
a single model to go from
burnup, enrichment -> composition matrix
perhaps a neural network? preliminary results
show that they are worse.
