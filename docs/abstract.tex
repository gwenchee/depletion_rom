    Fuel cycle simulations always battle between quickness and accuracy.

    Depletion calculations for fuel cycle simulations were either
    recipe based, [so on and so forth, with citation].

    We suggest a novel way to provide variable (continuously variable?) \gls{LWR} depletion calculations
        using trained prediction models.
    
    We fit best-performing regression models for each isotope as a function of burnup and enrichment
    
    We compared the \gls{UNF} inventory acquired by the model
        with the UNF-STANDARDS database and average recipe.
    
    [result]
    
    1.The model approach predicts \gls{UNF} inventory far better than the recipe approach, and takes
    into account the varying burnup and enrichment. 
    
    2. The model approach can predict the composition of future \gls{UNF} with
    higher burnup and enrichment [andrei]
