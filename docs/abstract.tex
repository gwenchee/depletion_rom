    Fuel cycle simulations always battle between quick and accurate.
    Depletion calculations for fuel cycle simulations were either
    recipe based, [so on and so forth, with citation].
    We suggest a novel way to provide variable (continuously variable?) \gls{LWR} depletion calculations
        using trained regression models.
    We fit best-performing regression models for each isotope as a function of burnup and enrichment
    We compared that to the UNF-STANDARDS database and average recipe.
