We trained a neural network model
to predict \gls{PWR} \gls{UNF} composition given initial enrichment
and burnup.
The model is trained using fuel depletion calculation
data from the \gls{UNF-STANDARDS} \gls{UDB}.

We validated the model by comparing the U.S. \gls{UNF} inventory profile
predicted by the model with the \gls{UDB} \gls{UNF} inventory
profile. Using the model yields less than 1.5\% error of
\gls{UNF} inventory decay heat and activity, and less than
5\% error for isotopic inventory. The neural network model
takes 0.12 seconds for 100 depletion calculations.

We also implemented this model into \Cyclus, an agent-based
\gls{NFC} simulator, to perform rapid, medium-fidelity
\gls{PWR}
depletion calculations. This model also allows discharge of
batches with varying burnup assemblies.

Since the original proprietary data cannot be retrieved from the model,
this trained model allows open-source depletion capabilities to \gls{NFC}
simulators. This method of training a reduced order model with a
dataset from a complex fuel depletion model
can provide rapid, medium-fidelity depletion capabilities
to large-scale fuel cycle simulations.
